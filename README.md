##Nagios Plugins
------------------------------
To fetch the data for those plugins, there are mainly two kinds of way depends on what the service provides:

* **BATCH** to fetch multiple metrics in one query (such as return a dictionary or even a tree)
* **DEDICATED** to fetch individual metrics with dedicated queries.

At the moment, there are 2 kinds of statistical value in general.

- **STATUS** value, the value at the moment of checking.
- **DELTA** value, the changes between now and the last time of checking. In most cases, these values are not provided by the service/servers. The services are more likely to provide a value since the server is started. Those values, such as *total connections*, *total operations* or *total bytes received* are incremental values, so it's impossible to set a threshold for warning and critical (as eventually it will pass over any value given). Thus we'll have to calculate the delta by comparing the current value with previously checked value. And we'll also have to store the current one for future comparison. By defining a rootdir and a filename with `-d ROOTDIR -f FILENAME`, the data will be store on disk. By default, rootdir is `/tmp` and the filenames looks like `pd@cmd2get_data`. For the first time running the script or if the file is not accessible (removed, rootdir changed, etc), the output value will not be delta value since there is no previous value referrable.

Values are either one of:

- **SINGLE** Most data sources has one value for each metrics.
- **MULTIPLE** Some data sources have provided more than one statistical value, i.e. sub-performance value, such as values of individual databases or of different types. We usually trail those after the total value.

In order to use any of the plugin, make sure you have `nagios.py` and `statsd.py` in PYTHONPATH or in the same folder with the `check_*.py` plugins you'll use.

###PostgreSQL

Check status for various metrics of PostgresSQL, with commandline access:
	
	python check_postgresql.py <options>

the options are:	

	usage: check_postgresql.py [-h] [-w WARN] [-c CRIT] -t
                               {DATABASE_SIZE, TUPLES_UPDATED, LOCKS_ROW, LOCKS_ACCESS, TUPLES_READ, LOCKS_SHARE, CONNECTIONS_WAITING, CONNECTIONS_IDLE, CONNECTIONS_ACTIVE, LOCKS_EXCLUSIVE, TUPLES_INSERTED, TUPLES_DELETED}
                               [-d ROOTDIR] [-f FILENAME] [-u USER] [-p PORT]
                               [-z APPNAME]                               

***Note:** If you are running PostgreSQL 9.2.x, you should use the *`check_postgresql_92.py`* script instead of *`check_postgresql.py`.* The options and arguments are exactly the same for both scripts. There is a separate script for 9.2 because PostgreSQL 9.2 introduced some changes to the statistics tables which require slightly different queries.*

##Data Module and Base Classes
------------------------------
*nagios.py* holds all the datatype class and base class for plugins.

    @plugin.command("BYTES_WRITTEN")
    
    


##StatsD Wrapping
------------------------------

*statsd.py* provides plugins an easy way to send performance value as statsd message. This module requires those files in [statsd_clients](https://github.com/appfirst/statsd_clients/)/python in PYTHON_PATH.

There are currently three statsd wrapper: `statsd.gauge`, `statsd.counter`, `statsd.timer`. The usage is quite intuitive, just add it to any method that returns a `nagios.Result` with a performance value. The wrapper will intercept the return value of the method, make the bucket name from the **BUCKET_PATTERN** (by default it's "**sys.app.%(appname)s.%(type)s**"). You can

	statsd.set_bucket_pattern(pattern)

to your own pattern. Available items from Result are: `appname`, `type`, `status_code`, `status`, `message`, `value` (the first of performance values).
By default this wrapper will send statsd to AppFirst Collector through AFTransport, but you can pass in your own transport by

	statsd.set_transport(transport)

Please reference details to [Statsd_clients](https://github.com/appfirst/statsd_clients/).

For plugins that has **STATUS** value, `gauge` is most likely to be suitable, those usually include memory usage, rate, active connection and total keys in databses.  
For plugins that has **DELTA** value, `counter` is most likely to be suitable, those usually include bytes transfered, operations, errors, newly established connections.

Here's an example of counter:

	@nagios.CommandBasedPlugin.command("BYTES_WRITTEN")
    @statsd.counter
    def get_bytes_written(self, request):
        return nagios.Result(type, status_code)

Note that the statsd descriptor should be applied after the `nagios.CommandBasedPlugin.command` descriptor in order to be executed if you are writing an CommandBasedPlugin.
